# fileicon &mdash; introduction

`fileicon` is a macOS CLI for managing custom icons for files and folders, as 
a programmatic alternative to interactively using Finder.

`fileicon` allows assigning a custom icon to any file or folder,
using [any image file whose format is recognized by the system](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/Images/Images.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003290-CH208-BCIIFBJG).

_Caveat_: Custom icons rely on [extended attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#OS_X) of the macOS filesystems, 
[HFS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus) and [APFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System).
Therefore, custom icons are lost when copying files or folders to filesystems that don't
support these attributes; for instance, custom icons cannot be stored in a Git repository.

When assigning an image file with `fileicon set`, a set of icons in several
resolutions is created and stored in the resource fork of the target file itself
/ of a hidden `Icon\r` file inside the target folder.

The icon with the highest resolution measures 512 x 512 pixels, and the input
image is scaled accordingly.  
Note that input images that aren't square can result in distorted icons;
for best results, provide square images.

# Examples

```sh
# Assign custom icon derived from image file 'img.png' to file 'foo':
fileicon set foo img.png

# Remove previously assigned custom icon from folder 'foodir':
fileicon rm foodir

# Extract custom icon from file 'foo' to icon file 'foo.icns':
fileicon get foo

# Test if folder 'foodir' has custom icon:
fileicon test foodir
```

# Installation

**Supported platforms**

* **macOS**

## Installation from the npm registry

With [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, install [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fileicon) as follows:

    [sudo] npm install fileicon -g

**Note**:

* Whether you need `sudo` depends on how you installed Node.js and whether you've [changed permissions later](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions); if you get an `EACCES` error, try again with `sudo`.
* The `-g` ensures [_global_ installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally) and is needed to put `fileicon` in your system's `$PATH`.

## Installation via Homebrew (macOS)

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run the following:

```sh
brew install fileicon
```

<sup>Tip of the hat to [@danielbayley](https://github.com/danielbayley) for submitting the formula.</sup>

## Manual installation

* Download [the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklement0/fileicon/stable/bin/fileicon) as `fileicon`.
* Make it executable with `chmod +x fileicon`.
* Move it or symlink it to a folder in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin` (requires `sudo`).

# Usage

Find concise usage information below; for complete documentation, read the [manual online](doc/fileicon.md), or, once installed, run `man fileicon` (`fileicon --man` if installed manually).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE FENCED CODE BLOCK and RETAIN THIS COMMENT: The fenced code block below is updated by `make update-readme/release` with CLI usage information. -->

```nohighlight
$ fileicon --help


Manage custom icons for files and folders on macOS.  

SET a custom icon for a file or folder:

    fileicon set      <fileOrFolder> [<imageFile>]

REMOVE a custom icon from a file or folder:

    fileicon rm       <fileOrFolder>

GET a file or folder's custom icon:

    fileicon get [-f] <fileOrFolder> [<iconOutputFile>]

    -f ... force replacement of existing output file

TEST if a file or folder has a custom icon:

    fileicon test     <fileOrFolder>

All forms: option -q silences status output.

Standard options: --help, --man, --version, --home
```

# Changelog

Versioning complies with [semantic versioning (semver)](http://semver.org/).

<!-- NOTE: An entry template for a new version is automatically added each time `make version` is called. Fill in changes afterwards. -->

* **[v0.2.3](https://github.com/mklement0/fileicon/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)** (2019-11-01):
  * [enhancement] Installation via Homebrew is now possible on macOS.
  * [doc] `README.md` updated with Homebrew installation instructions.
  * [dev] Updated dev-time-only packages to fix security issues.

* **[v0.2.2](https://github.com/mklement0/fileicon/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2)** (2018-03-05):
  * [enhancement] `filecon set <file>` is now short for `filecon set <file> <file>`; that is, you can now more 
    conveniently make an image file use itself as its icon.

* **[v0.2.1](https://github.com/mklement0/fileicon/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)** (2018-01-13):
  * [doc] Read-me improvements re supported image formats.
  * [enhancement] Improved wording of error message on attempting to use a pipe
    such as via a process subsitution (`<(...)`) in lieu of an actual image file,
    which is not supported.

* **[v0.2.0](https://github.com/mklement0/fileicon/compare/v0.1.10...v0.2.0)** (2017-10-14):
  * [compatibility] macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) is now supported.
  * [enhancement] Switched from using `sips -i` for icon creation to a Python-based
                  Cocoa call to `NSWorkSpace.setIcon(_:forFile:options:)`, courtesy of https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/161984/28668
                  As a result, icons in multiple resolutions are now generated, with a top resolution of 512 x 512 pixels (previously: 128 x 128)
  * [doc] More technical background added to `README.md`.
  * [usability] subcommands are now case-insensitive, and 'remove' is supported as an alias of 'rm'.

* **[v0.1.8](https://github.com/mklement0/fileicon/compare/v0.1.7...v0.1.8)** (2016-04-21):

          newer npm versions.
  * [fix] Folder write test is now properly skipped for 'get' and 'test'
          commands - thanks, @zmwangx.
  * [fix] 'get' command now properly reports errors if icon extracton fails
           - thanks, @zmwangx.
